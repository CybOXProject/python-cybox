# python-cybox

A python library for parsing, manipulating, and generating CybOX content.

This currently consists of only the XML-to-Python bindings files, but in the
future will contain many helper utilities and a more intuitive API.

For more information about CybOX, see http://cybox.mitre.org.


## Installation

The 'cybox' package depends on the 'lxml' XML parsing library.

To build `lxml` on Ubuntu, you will need the following packages from the
Ubuntu package repository:

* python-dev
* libxml2-dev
* libxslt1-dev

For more information about installing lxml, see
http://lxml.de/installation.html
